Run Values by Event
===================

Work inspired by Chapter 1 of [The Book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GW6A89Y) and Chapter 5 of [Analyzing Baseball Data with R](http://www.amazon.com/Analyzing-Baseball-Data-Chapman-Hall-ebook/dp/B00GBC36S4/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1409819843&sr=1-1&keywords=Analyzing+Baseball+Data+with+R).

This work depends on [loading the Retrosheet play-by-play event data into a PostgreSQL database](/retrosheet/).
